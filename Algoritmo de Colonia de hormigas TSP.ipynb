This kind of algorithms is widely used in the resolution of graph-based problem, and one common use for them is the resolution of the TSP. The algorithm simulates the paths taking by several decision agents known as \"ants\" during a number of determined iterations\n","\n","\n","The code presented int his blog was adapted from :\n","\n","Wong, C.

Because the TSP is represented by a weighted undirected graph, is convenient to represent an instance of the problem using a weight matrix, that represents the distances between each node of the graph.
